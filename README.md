 =====  The requirements for this assignment are as follows  =======
 
1. Goal Identification

2. Site-map Creation: 
Create a sitemap to archive the goals gathered in stage one. The sitemap should provide a clear idea of the website's information architecture and explain the relationships between the various pages and content elements.

3. Wire-frame Creation:
 After creating the sitemap, the next step is to wireframe the sitemap contents and structure the site's visual design and content elements. The wireframe will help identify potential challenges and gaps with the sitemap and act as a guide for how the site will ultimately look.

4. Mock-up Creation:
 Implement a mock-up using the wireframe designed in the previous stage. The mock-up will provide a lively preview of the website before implementing it.

5. Redesign for Four Devices:
 Redesign the same mock-up for four different devices - desktop, laptop, tablet, and mobile. Use modern UIs and modern color schemes while planning the assignment.
